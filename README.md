# JavaCookbook
## When we consider a Java program, it can be defined as a collection of objects that communicate via invoking each other's methods.
- Object − Objects have states and behaviors. Example: A dog has states - color, name, breed as well as behavior such as wagging their tail, barking, eating. An object is an instance of a class.
- Class − A class can be defined as a template/blueprint that describes the behavior/state that the object of its type supports.
- Methods − A method is basically a behavior. A class can contain many methods. It is in methods where the logics are written, data is manipulated and all the actions are executed.
- Instance Variables − Each object has its unique set of instance variables. An object's state is created by the values assigned to these instance variables.


## About Java programs, it is very important to keep in mind the following points.
- Case Sensitivity − Java is case sensitive, which means identifier Hello and hello would have different meaning in Java.
- Class Names − For all class names the first letter should be preferably in Upper Case. If several words are used to form a name of the class, each inner word's first letter should be in Upper Case. Example: class MyFirstJavaClass
- Method Names − All method names should preferably start with a Lower Case letter. If several words are used to form the name of the method, then each inner word's first letter should be in Upper Case. Example: public void myMethodName()
- Program File Name − Name of the program file should exactly match the public class name. Each file can contain only one public class. Example: Assume 'MyFirstJavaProgram' is the class name. Then the file should be saved as 'MyFirstJavaProgram.java'
- public static void main(String args[]) − Java program processing starts from the main() method which is a mandatory part of every Java program.
